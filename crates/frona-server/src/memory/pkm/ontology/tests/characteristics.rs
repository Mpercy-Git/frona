//! What each OWL property characteristic is contracted to do - pinned in both
//! directions, over the real path a consolidation pass takes: entities + links →
//! ABox → `frona:` delta → OWL 2 RL closure.
//!
//! Two things break silently without this file, and both have already happened
//! once in this stack:
//!
//!   1. **A reasoner rule that stops firing.** `reasonable` is a pinned third-party
//!      crate. A characteristic that quietly stops deriving anything leaves the
//!      graph merely *thinner*, never wrong-looking, so nothing downstream
//!      complains - entities just stop being connected.
//!   2. **A reasoner rule that fires too widely.** This is why
//!      `owl:InverseFunctionalProperty` is not in [`Characteristic`]:
//!      `reasonable` 0.4.4's `prp-ifp` emits `owl:sameAs` between the subjects of
//!      *any* two assertions of the property, ignoring their objects entirely
//!      (`reasoner.rs` binds the second object as a fresh pattern variable instead
//!      of comparing it). The last test here measures that, so the exclusion stays
//!      justified by a number rather than by a comment - and so a future crate bump
//!      that fixes it shows up as a failure asking for the decision to be revisited.
//!
//! Every characteristic therefore gets a **pair**: the case that must fire, and the
//! near-miss that must not. A rule that over-fires passes the first and fails the
//! second.
