    description: An array of proposed schema edits to dry-run. Each edit is an object with an `op` field and its operands, all CURIEs. Ops - `declare_class {class}`, `sub_class_of {sub, sup}`, `equivalent_classes {a, b}`, `disjoint_classes {a, b}`, `declare_object_property {property}`, `declare_data_property {property}`, `sub_property_of {sub, sup}`, `equivalent_properties {a, b}`, `inverse_properties {a, b}`, `object_property_domain {property, class}`, `object_property_range {property, class}`.

Dry-run a set of proposed schema edits without committing them: reports any logical clash they would introduce (a class made unsatisfiable, a disjointness violation). An empty/"consistent" result means the edits are safe to commit. Always test a non-trivial edit — especially a new subclass, equivalence, or disjointness axiom — before adjudicating it.
