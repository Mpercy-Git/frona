    description: A SPARQL 1.1 SELECT or ASK query. The bundled prefixes (schema:, foaf:, skos:, dcterms:, frona:, rdf:, rdfs:, owl:, xsd:) are pre-declared — no PREFIX header needed. Knowledge-base individuals use the `<urn:frona:kb:{page-path}>` IRI.

Query the user's reasoned knowledge graph — the materialized OWL closure — with SPARQL. One endpoint over both the schema (TBox: classes, subclass/domain/range, alignments) and the data (ABox: typed individuals + their asserted and inferred links). Use it to look up what a class subsumes, find individuals of a type, traverse relations, or confirm an entailment before acting. Read-only. Prefer this over guessing the schema.
